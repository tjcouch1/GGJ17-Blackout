# GGJ17-Blackout
Global Game Jam 2017 sound-based puzzle platformer game

Trapped in a pitch-black warehouse, sound waves are your only tool for seeing the environment. Get through this puzzle-platformer to turn on the lights and reveal where you really are!

Made in a team of seven for [Global Game Jam 2017](https://globalgamejam.org/2017/games/blackout-0). I was the programmer.
