I have some light scatters. The screen will be black for now, and the lights will reveal the environment. I think we can combine our ideas to make it work really well!

All those little bits are going to show on top of the darkness

Right now, you can't push stacked boxes. Too heavy

before stuck
image_alpha = life / lifecap
lifealpha = image_alpha

after stuck

image_alpha = lifealpha * life / lifecap

I'll fix taht soon

Do you have your art?

Where is the code for the lighting?
